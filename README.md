### System requirements

These compilation instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 12.4 x64 only with Java 1.7.0_80


## Linux Build Notes (on Ubuntu 12.4 x64 only with Java 1.7.0_80)

### ClassPath dependencies

    * Java 1.7.0 is needed, upper version should be compatible
	* Project uses [Gson API](https://github.com/google/gson)

### Notes

* The classpath file is called "project.classpath" and has to ne rename in ".classpath" for compilation.

## Architecture

### Global Architecture
The goal of the API is to directly integrate calls to command system and Json Formating to make Java developing easier :

![alt tag](Archi.png)

The initial mind of the project is to manage Wallet.
There's no command to manage the BlockChain like : create a blockChain, join a blockChain, ...
Theses commands are more linked with the system.
Next versions will decide to integrate (or not) theses commands.

### Project Architecture

#### multichain.command
The package `multichain.command` is the essential of the project.
The package contains Java commands to call.

Examples of command calls can be found in `command`.

A simple example to get addresses :
```
//BlockChain TestCommand has to be created and started before
ChainCommand.initializeChain("TestCommand");

List<String> result = null;
try {
	result = AddressCommand.getAddresses();
} catch (MultichainException e) {
	// TODO Auto-generated catch block
	e.printStackTrace();
}

//result contains the addresses of the wallet as list of String.
```


#### multichain.object
The package `multichain.object` contains Java objects which can be used to call functions or returned by functions.

The package contains `formatters` with technical classes used to format Json to Java using [Gson API](https://github.com/google/gson).

#### formatters
The package `multichain.test` contains Java unit test.
Test are written with `main()` function to be executed whatever IDE or system used.

The package `command` has to contain unit tests for each command.
The package `object.formatters` is helpful to test the good work of Formatters Json<->Java.


## Versions

### 1.0

Integrated functions about :
* Block
* Address
* Grant
* Balance
* Wallet

* Transaction
* Transaction	RAW

Todo :
* integrate new functions (actually MultiChain Alpha 28)
